I work in a laboratory where i am trying to link 2 systems, by creating a webapp called LabGuru-Dashboard
from kranium, i get tests names and prices 
and from labguru i get invoice number, lab number, date, and test name again to match with test names i get from kranium. 
now the biggest challenge is that we need to get the invoice number and labnumber from labguru but not store them in my local database 
but use it to populate tables and charts while quering the labguru database 
we shall get read only database access from the labguru dev team but let me scrape for the mvp but modify my scraper so that it doesnt fetch
labnumber and invoice as well as the other fields that are already not being used like tel, patient id etc.. 
we need an admin panel to modify the test names, price, turn around time per test and laboratory section which is also set per test.
 we shall install a database locally to store the rest of the data and the data that will be generated. 
 we shall have the following tables in it.but remember we dont have labnumber and invoice in these tables 
 because we are not allowed to store info particularly tied to the patient because we are not the main data
 management system. i have attached files that where previously creating these tables but we need to modify then to remove 
 labnumber storage and invoice number storage but mantain all the rest of the logic that converts labnumbers into time in
 we nologer need saas logic because we are custom building for one client so we shall remove all r2 logging, client and subscription logic,
 developer user, then we create an admin panel for modifying managing users,tests, etc...
 i have attached another file that was scraping data from lab guru that 
i want to eliminate but you need to see the fields i am interested in from labguru and these are:
        "EncounterDate": "2025-08-27",
        "InvoiceNo": "461730",
        "LabNo": "27082513220157",
        "Src": "DOCTORS PLAZA",
        "TestName": "Complete Blood Count CBC"
i have another script exctracting timeout from another shared drive because labguru doesnt provide a time for priting results so we track files
as they are created at the time of printing the report. here is a sample of that file: 
FileName,CreationTime
50084898,01/25/2026 04:47 PM
501046,10/07/2025 07:21 AM
501077,10/07/2025 12:29 PM
501778,10/07/2025 05:13 PM
501868,10/07/2025 06:10 PM
501871,10/07/2025 06:11 PM
502010,10/07/2025 10:10 PM

i need to import the meta data for the start then be able to manage it and all its crud operations in admin panel and here is a sample of meta.csv
TestName,TAT,LabSection,Price
17-Hydroxy Progesterone,17280,REFERRAL,130000
17-OH PROGESTERONE,17280,REFERRAL,125460
24 hrs Urine Protein,1440,CHEMISTRY,543660
24Hr Urine Cortisol,1440,CHEMISTRY,65000
50g OGTT (Pregnancy),240,CHEMISTRY,89760
75g OGTT,240,CHEMISTRY,89760
ACE,17280,REFERRAL,200000

we are going to link to create charts for daily tests, revenue, requests and monitor turn around time in real time with kpis 
and we shall do this one module at a time starting with revenue which will have daily revenue chart, revenue per laboratorysection, 
revenue per test for the top 50 tests.
we shall have date filters, lab section filters,period filters for monthly and quarterly with all months jan to dec 
and another for all quarters. we shall have have a dashboard with panels for each page where panels are in the design of mahjong chinese game
cubes with pages:
revenue
tests
numbers
tat
meta table
performance table
meta table
progress table
laboratory report information display system or LRIDS in short
reception table
tracker table
i will explain and add these pages later as we shall first create an mvp with just revenue module,admin panel and meta table.

   they IT team concern was the fact that we dont need to store labnumber and invoice because they can be used to track or link to other 
   patient details 
   i need a login page and role based access for manager who can view charts, technician
who only sees tables and viewer for displaying lrids table on screens in waiting areas for reports progress in real time.
the new mvp has been built with the following stack:
Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Recharts + vite
Backend: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
Database: PostgreSQL (local) + Read-only access to LabGuru DB
Authentication: JWT with role-based access
Real-time: Socket.io for dashboard updates
 the files i have attached from the previous app are just to show you what i expect in terms of filters, charts, design, pages.
 i want the styles to match exactly but in tailwind. the log in page, and all tables and charts should look exactly as those attached old files
 all previous javascript is combined in mvp.js and all css in all.css
 the html files for log in page, revenue, meta, admin panel, lrids are all attached individually just to show you exactly how i want my new app to
 look like.
 i want to load data from my meta.csv and timeout.csv and data.js though labnumber and invoice are going to be there for this mvp as we wait for
 database access credentials so i will put those files in the public folder and expect to see charts rendering with historical data
 we shall treat the labnumber and invoice number as though where from the labguru database and we should not store them in my database.
